## What is Fuel Economy?
Car fuel economy is directly related to miles per gallon, or MPG or miles per gallon electric (MPGe). The higher its mpg, the better your car's fuel economy.

*Your car's fuel economy - how far your vehicle can go using a specific amount of fuel - can have a real impact on your expenses. Choosing a vehicle with good fuel economy or taking steps to boost the fuel economy of your current vehicle, just might save you money at the gas pump.*

## Data 
For this project, I referred to [Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/) and downloaded the data from [data.world](https://data.world/project-data-viz/vehicle-mpg-1984-to-2023-pdv-02-2023). This has data for the period of 1984 - 2023.

### Pre-processing-cleaning the dataset
I renamed the column for few of the columns which I used to avoid spaces in the column name. Apart from that, I used the data as-is.

## Tools
For this project, I used Streamlit, pandas for data frame, Altair for visualization. I have done this project in Tableau [What is Fuel Economy](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jibeesh.gopi/viz/FuelEconomy-VehicleMPG/WhatisFuelEconomy). It was little challenging to duplicate what I did in Tableau, but in the end I kept it simple as I am still learning streamlit and altair. It was fun learning to implement what I did in the Tableau version.
